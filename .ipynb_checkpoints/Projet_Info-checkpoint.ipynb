    "For the sequential shortest paths problem, we chose to implement Dijktra's algorithm with heap queue. Indeed, as the costs of the arcs are all said to be positive, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm can be applied and is more efficient than Bellman-Ford's algorithm $(O(|E|+|V|\\log(|V|))$ when implemented with heap queue against $O(|E||V|)$).)\n",
